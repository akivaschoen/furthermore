### Creating Posts
* Wasted too much time looking at different CLJS tools and debating with myself whether I really needed the traditional MVC folder structure.
* Ripped a bunch of code from the Clojure subwave rebuild so getting a post created and rendered was a snap.
* Next up: creating topics and linking posts to those topics.

### First Commit
* Starting from zero lines of code.
* First steps will be to produce a post that can be committed to a database. Since there's no UI, I'll be doing initial updates by hand from text files. Luckily, I can borrow most of this code from the aborted conversion of [subwave](https://www.github.com/akivaschoen/subwave) from Node to Clojure.
* After that, I'll get into setting up Mongo and committing posts. The architecture for this is already in my head; I'll write more about it when the time comes. Here we go!
